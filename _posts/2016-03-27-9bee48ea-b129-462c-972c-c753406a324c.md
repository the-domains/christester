In the late 1800s, New York's churches began to decorate their sanctuaries with Easter flowers. Parishioners walked from church to church to inspect the floral displays --- and so began the custom of the NYC Easter parade. 

Centered around Fifth Avenue and open to anyone, the parade grew in stature to something of a major event. Well-to-do New Yorkers attired in the latest modes strolled through the boulevards, watched by middle class citizens eager for the lowdown on new fashion trends. 

By 1880, the Easter parade had became a permanent fixture on New York's calendar of civic and social events. As such, milliners and merchants capitalized on the opportunity to promote their wares. 

With the turn of the new century, Easter in New York had assumed the mantle of a major retail event, ranking alongside Christmas in this significance.
